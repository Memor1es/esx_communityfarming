# esx_communityfarming
Community farming resource for ESX servers on FiveM

(This is my first FiveM resource, it may be unoptimized or written poorly but I'm happy with the result)

### Features
- Configuration options to change map blip, marker locations and uniforms
- Easily modify, add and remove your own farms in the config file to setup as many farms as you like as big or small as you like (note: more farms and bigger sizes may cause performance loss)

### Download & Installation
1. Clone this repository somewhere in your resources folder (probably resources/[esx])
2. Import `esx_communityfarming.sql` into your database
3. Add `ensure esx_communityfarming` into your server.cfg file
